## About The Project

In a data-driven world, content creators and social media managers need to quickly assess what's working. However, raw data exported from social platforms is often just a wall of numbers. **TrueInsight** solves this by providing an instant, in-browser solution to parse, clean, and visualize this data, revealing key performance indicators and content quality scores at a glance.

The best part? **No backend or database is required.** All processing happens directly in the user's browser, making it fast, private, and easy to use.
